# Let's solve flatland!
This is a community effort to solve the [2020 NeurIPS Flatland Challenge](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/neurips-2020-flatland-challenge).
The flatland environment is [here](https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/flatland/flatland) and its [Documentation](http://flatland.aicrowd.com/intro.html)

## How do I contribute?
Fork this repository and submit a pull request.

## TODOs
- Write boilerplate to interact with the environment. It is already a gym environment, so unclear if this is necessary, maybe code to visualize a run.
- Write simple baseline algorithms for pure RL and pure hard-coded heuristics.
- Write some documentation here about how to evaluate an algorithm, maybe we define some joint format for results so we can compare.

## Libraries to consider
- [DeepMind ACME](https://github.com/deepmind/acme) has a lot of RL built-in.
